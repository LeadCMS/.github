Thank you for your interest in joining the LeadCMS team! This assignment will help us evaluate your skills in full-stack development, integration, and modern web tooling.

## Overview
Create a personal portfolio website that showcases your skills and projects, integrated with **LeadCMS** as the content management system. This assignment will demonstrate your ability to work with modern web technologies, design user interfaces, and integrate with external content APIs.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **LeadCMS Integration**
   - Install and run LeadCMS locally ([Docker Compose Guide](https://github.com/LeadCMS/leadcms.core/blob/develop/docker-compose/README.md)).
   - Fetch and display personal information from LeadCMS (e.g., home.mdx content)
   - Display a list of projects with filtering/sorting capabilities
   - Show detailed project pages with all project data (technologies, features, challenges, results, etc.)
   - Handle dynamic content updates from the CMS
   - Add at least three different content types: MDX, JSON, images

2. **Essential Pages**
   - **Homepage**: Personal introduction, skills showcase, experience summary, list of completed projects
   - **Project Detail**: Individual project pages with comprehensive information

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
   - Modern, professional aesthetic

4. **Design Approach**
   - Create your own design or use AI design tools like [v0.app](https://v0.app) or similar
   - Focus on clean, professional aesthetics and excellent user experience

### Technical Requirements

- Connect to LeadCMS API to fetch:
  - Personal information (from home.mdx content)
  - Project listings (from projects)
  - Dynamic content updates
- Display MDX, JSON, and image content on the site

- Reference the provided test site for integration examples (if available)

### Technology Recommendations
